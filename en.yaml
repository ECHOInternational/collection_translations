      name: Agroforestry
      description: |-
        <p>In simplest language, agroforestry is the production of trees and of non-tree crops or animals on the same piece of land. The crops can be grown together at the same time, can be grown in rotation, or can even be grown in separate plots when materials from one are used to benefit another. However, this simple definition fails to take into account the integrated concepts associated with agroforestry that make this system of land management possibly the most self-sustaining and ecologically sound of any agricultural system. Thus, a second definition of agroforestry would be the integration of trees, plants, and animals in conservative, long-term, productive systems.</p>
        <p>Agroforestry can be considered more as an approach than as a single, finished technology. Although several finished systems have been devised and tested, such technology may require adjustment for particular situations. The flexibility of the agroforestry approach is one of its advantages.

        <p><strong>Home gardens are found in many humid and sub-humid parts of the world. They are sometimes called backyard or kitchen gardens. These gardens have an established tradition and offer great potential for improving household food security and alleviating micronutrient deficiencies. Gardening can enhance food security in several ways, most importantly through: 1) direct access to a diversity of nutritionally-rich foods, 2) increased purchasing power from savings on food bills and income from sales of garden products, and 3) fall-back food provision during seasonal lean periods.</strong></p>
        <p>One of the easiest ways of ensuring access to a healthy diet (see <a href=\"https://www.echocommunity.org/resources/1e3d348e-b689-4860-a810-2134405c734e\">Nutrition Education and Training</a>) that contains adequate macroand micronutrients is to produce many different kinds of foods in the home garden. This is especially important in rural areas where people have limited income-earning opportunities and poor access to markets. Home gardens are also becoming an increasingly important source of food and income for poor households in peri-urban and urban areas.</p>
        <p>A well-developed home garden has the potential, when access to land and water is not a major limitation, to supply most of the non-staple foods that a family needs every day of the year, including roots and tubers, vegetables and fruits, legumes, herbs and spices, animals and fish. Roots and tubers are rich in energy and legumes are important sources of protein, fat, iron and vitamins. Green leafy vegetables and yellowor orange-coloured fruits provide essential vitamins and minerals, particularly folate, and vitamins A, E and C. Vegetables and fruits are a vital component of a healthy diet and should be eaten as part of every meal. Meat, chicken and fish are good sources of protein, fat and micronutrients, particularly iron and zinc. They are especially important in small children&#39;s diets to ensure normal growth and intellectual development.   --FAO</p>

      description: |-
        <p>Farmers in many parts of the world, because of human population growth, have little choice but to crop their land continuously, with scarce resources to replace nutrients withdrawn by each successive crop. Crop residues are often lost as a source of organic matter and mulch, usually through burning or by removal for animal feed or cooking fuel. Especially where nutrient reserves are already low, and topsoil is exposed to erosion, soils lose their capacity to sustain adequate crop yields. Additionally, extreme weather events, adverse changes in climate, human conflict, and sickness can all work against smallholder farmers&rsquo; abilities to sustain the productive capacity of their soils. Conservation Agriculture attempts to address these problems.</p>
        <p>Conservation agriculture (CA) is a resource-saving land management approach that optimizes and sustains the capacity of soils to produce food. In CA, sustainability is linked to the ecological preservation of agricultural landscapes. This is achieved through 1) minimal soil disturbance, 2) keeping soils covered, and 3) crop diversification. Implementing these three elements requires a combination of practices, for which there are many options. Thinking of CA as an overall system, rather than a fixed set of techniques, gives farmers and practitioners the freedom to evaluate and adopt a set of CA-related practices appropriate to local needs.</p>

        <p>&quot;The number of undernourished people in the world remains unacceptably high at about 925 million. Global food security issues exist now, and are especially of concern looking forward as world population is expected to increase by about 35% over the next 40 years. Agricultural output will need to significantly increase to accommodate the growing population. Most of the increase is expected to come from producing more on existing farmland (i.e., intensification), although some new farmland will likely be needed. Boosting crop yields and closing the gap between actual and attainable yield can be achieved by the implementation and advancement of numerous practices and technologies, including nutrient management practices and fertilizer technologies. An evaluation of long-term studies has shown that the average percent of yield attributable to fertilizer inputs generally ranged from about 40 to 60% in temperate climates (USA and England), and tended to be much higher in the tropics. All things considered, inorganic fertilizer plays a critical role in world food security, but it must be recognized that highest yields are in some systems the result of using both organic and inorganic nutrient sources. Adoption of the 4R principles-right nutrient source at the right rate, right time, and right place-help ensure appropriate use of nutrient resources and optimized productivity.&quot;</p>

      description: |-
        <p>FAO Field Manual :</p>
        <p>Plants have two ways of reproduction, sexual by means of seeds, and asexually or vegetatively by means of vegetative tissue. Both ways occur in living plants in nature. In nature, some plants reproduce mainly vegetatively while others rely almost totally on sexual reproduction. For the plant breeder it is desirable to be able to manipulate sexual and vegetative reproduction (propagation) to fit into the tree improvement programme.</p>
        <p>Genetically the two ways of reproduction differ. Seeds contain genes from the female parent (where we collect the seeds) and the male parent (which contribute the pollen and which is often unknown). Vegetative material is genetically identical to the mother plant from where it was collected. The present guide entirely deals with vegetative propagation.</p>
        <p><strong>There are four main uses of vegetative propagation in a Tree Breeding Programme:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The establishment of clonal seed orchards.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The establishment of clonal banks.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The propagation of special breeding material, e.g. exceptional hybrids that are lost through sexual reproduction, sterile hybrids etc.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mass propagation of selected materials.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are several ways of vegetative propagation. The three main types in forest tree propagation are grafting, air-layering and the use of cuttings. The three types are referred to as macropropagation, as alternative to micropropagation or tissue culture. Propagation by cuttings is the most convenient and cheapest method and usually preferred when possible. Air-layering is a variation of propagation by stem cuttings in which root formation is initiated before the plant part is separated from the mother tree. In grafting, the shoot (scion) of the desired tree is joined with a root (stock or root stock) of different genetic origin.</p>
        <p>Which methods of propagation to be used in a particular situation is a matter of experience with the individual tree species plus the purpose and conditions of the propagation. The methodologies of vegetative propagation should be adapted to the individual plant species. The same method may work differently at a different time of the year, etc. </p>

        <p>Composting is the natural process of &#39;rotting&#39; or decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms under controlled conditions. Raw organic materials such as crop residues, animal wastes, food garbage, some municipal wastes and suitable industrial wastes, enhance their suitability for application to the soil as a fertilizing resource, after having undergone composting.</p>
        <p>Compost is a rich source of organic matter. Soil organic matter plays an important role in sustaining soil fertility, and hence in sustainable agricultural production. In addition to being a source of plant nutrient, it improves the physico-chemical and biological properties of the soil. As a result of these improvements, the soil: (i) becomes more resistant to stresses such as drought, diseases and toxicity; (ii) helps the crop in improved uptake of plant nutrients; and (iii) possesses an active nutrient cycling capacity because of vigorous microbial activity. These advantages manifest themselves in reduced cropping risks, higher yields and lower outlays on inorganic fertilizers for farmers.</p>

        <p>Weeds are important biotic constraint to food production. Weeds compete with crops for the same resources, basically water, nutrients, light and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, they are alternate hosts for crop pests and pathogens. Moreover, some of them lack autotrophy and fully develop only by parasitizing crops or wild hosts. Globalization of trade and weak legislations on weed control in most of the developing countries has favored spread of Invasive Alien Plants (IAP).</p>
        <p>Weeds, in general, precede crops on farming lands and are major yield reducing factors. In ecological terms, most annual weeds are r-strategists, establishing populations with high relative growth rate (r). Thus, they produce numerous viable seeds and their populations quickly build up, in an exponential pattern. Weed competition with crops reduces agricultural output (quantity and quality), and increases external costs by spreading them across farm boundaries. It is also a major constraint to increased farmers&rsquo; productivity, particularly in developing countries where weed control claims 20 to 50 % of farmers&rsquo; time and keep smallholders in a vicious circle of poverty.</p>

With demand and competition for water on the rise, however, the planet&rsquo;s water resources are under increasing stress due to climate change, poor management and pollution. </p><p>Agriculture holds the key to successfully achieving the objectives and aspirations articulated in the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. It is also crucial to the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers and rural communities worldwide.</p><p>Farmers must be at the centre of any process of change in agriculture. Through appropriate policies that provide incentives and ensure effective governance, farmers can be empowered to conserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems and minimize environmental impacts.</p><p>- FAO</p>"

While large scale operations may benefit from investing in costly handling machinery and high-tech postharvest treatments, often these options are not practical for small-scale handlers. Instead, simple, low cost technologies often can be more appropriate for small volume, limited resource commercial operations, farmers involved in direct marketing, as well as for suppliers to exporters in developing countries.</p><p>--  FAO</p><p>The causes of food losses and waste in low-income countries are mainly connected to financial, managerial and technical limitations in harvesting techniques, storage and cooling facilities in difficult climatic conditions, infrastructure, packaging and marketing systems. Given that many smallholder farmers in developing countries live on the margins of food insecurity, a reduction in food losses could have an immediate and significant impact on their livelihoods.</p><p>The food supply chains in developing countries need to be strengthened by, inter alia, encouraging small farmers to organize and to diversify and upscale their production and marketing.

The underlying problem is lack of rainfall needed for growing plants. The second is accumulation of salts in the root zone. The two are interrelated, but do not necessarily occur together.</p><p>Plants need a certain amount of soluble salts, but excess salts in the root zone reduces plant growth by altering water uptake. When the salt content of soil water is greater than that of the water inside the plant cells, the plant roots cannot absorb the soil water. They may even lose water to the soil. Excess soil salts can also cause ion-specific toxicities or imbalances. In some cases, the cure for these problems is to simply improve drainage. However, salinity problems are often more complex and require proper soil management as well as use of salt tolerant crops.</p>"

First, the future state is unknown when you begin, and is determined through trial and error as new information is gathered. This makes it impossible to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; transformation with pre-determined, time-bound and linear project plans. You can have an over-arching change strategy, but the actual change process literally must &ldquo;emerge&rdquo; as you go. This means that your executives, managers and frontline workers alike must operate in the unknown&mdash;that scary, unpredictable place where stress skyrockets and emotions run high.</p><p>Second, the future state is so radically different than the current state that the people and culture must change to implement it successfully. New mindsets and behaviors are required. In fact, often leaders and workers must shift their worldviews to even invent the required new future, let alone operate it effectively.</p><p>Without these &ldquo;inner&rdquo; shifts of mindset and culture, the &ldquo;external&rdquo; implementation of new structures, systems, processes or technology do not produce their intended ROI. For example, many large IT implementations fail because they require a mindset and culture change that does not occur, i.e., the new systems require people to share information across strongly held boundaries or put the needs of the enterprise over their own turf agendas. Without these changes in attitude and behavior, people do not use the technology as designed and the change fails to deliver its ROI.</p><p>Because transformation impacts people so personally, you must get them involved in it to garner their support; and the earlier the better! &quot;</p>"

Furthermore, although rapid urbanisation is taking place in many developing countries, farming populations in 2030 will not be much smaller than they are today. For the foreseeable future, therefore, dealing with poverty and hunger in much of the world means confronting the problems that small farmers and their families face in their daily struggle for survival.</p><p>Investment priorities and policies must take into account the immense diversity of opportunities and problems facing small farmers.

      description: "<p>Property rights exist at many different social levels (individual, nuclear or extended family, clan or tribe, larger group, etc.), and at different levels of &ldquo;formality&rdquo; or official status. For example, an urban property may have an individual owner and a government-issued (formal) title. For this kind of property, it can be simple and straightforward to understand the exact identity of the officially recognized owner (by looking at the title) and the means to transfer rights to that property (through sale or rental). Understanding rights to use areas owned by larger numbers of people&mdash;extended families, clans, or certain ethnic groups&mdash;is much more complex. For example, access rights to grazing or fishing areas vary seasonally, or according to one&rsquo;s clan or tribal status. There are usually local regulations concerning how group members and non-group members can use the land and its water or plant resources, and these are often not recorded on paper. Nonmembers may have access to the land if they contribute to some group event or pay someone for use rights. Resource rights at this level are likely regulated by local leaders rather than a recognized government authority, and are called &ldquo;informal&rdquo; or &ldquo;customary&rdquo; or &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; rights.</p><p><em>- Dr. Laura Meitzner Yoder, EDN # 106</em></p>"

      description: "<p>Building with earthbags (sometimes called sandbags) is both old and new. Sandbags have long been used, particularly by the military, for creating strong, protective barriers, or for flood control. The same reasons that make them useful for these applications carry over to creating housing. Since the walls are so substantial, they resist all kinds of severe weather (or even bullets) and also stand up to natural calamities such as earthquakes and floods. They can be erected simply and quickly with readily available components, for very little money.</p><p>Earthbag building fills a unique niche in the quest for sustainable architecture. The bags can be filled with local, natural materials, which lowers the embodied energy commonly associated with the manufacture and transportation of building materials. The fill material is generally of mineral composition and is not subject to decomposition (even when damp), attractive to vermin, or burnable...in other word it is extremely durable. The fill material is generally completely non-toxic and will not offgas noxious fumes into the building.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/\">--earthbagbuilding.com</a></p>"

      description: "<p>While fulfilling the food demand of an increasing population remains a major global concern, more than one-third of food is lost or wasted in postharvest operations. Reducing the postharvest losses, especially in developing countries, could be a sustainable solution to increase food availability, reduce pressure on natural resources, eliminate hunger and improve farmers&rsquo; livelihoods. Cereal grains are the basis of staple food in most of the developing nations, and account for the maximum postharvest losses on a calorific basis among all agricultural commodities. As much as 50%&ndash;60% cereal grains can be lost during the storage stage due only to the lack of technical inefficiency. Use of scientific storage methods can reduce these losses to as low as 1%&ndash;2%.</p><p>--  <a href=\"https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/9aaaf1d2-ace5-49d4-88bf-3326c2f84153\">Reducing Post Harvest Losses, Foods, 2017</a></p><p>Postharvest losses can be extensively avoided. A survey of farmers showed that for 44 per cent of respondents the avoidance of grain losses has been the most positive change brought about by the introduction of silos. The use of silos has helped to increase food security by 30&ndash;35 days per year.<br /><br />The owner of a silo can save more or earn more. Immediately after the harvest, when supply is greatest in local markets as well as in the cities, the price for maize is at its lowest. However, anyone who can safely store the maize for a few months prior to selling can count on a higher price, or conversely on making a saving by not having to buy when the market price is high. At the time of the harvest, between November and February, about 80 per cent of farmers sell their maize rather than storing it in a silo. In the critical period before the next harvest, between March and July, the situation is almost reversed, with 73 per cent selling only maize stored in the silo.</p><p>---   <a href=\"http://www.rural21.com/english/news/detail/article/simple-technology-big-impact-00001416/\">RURAL21</a></p>"

      name: Extension Using Video
      description: "<p>There are many advantages to using video to share ideas with an audience. To start with, it combines both visual and audio dimensions, bringing situations and faraway contexts alive in a way that written texts or photos on their own cannot. Video is attractive for training purposes because it shows actions that can be difficult to explain with words alone. Video is also an excellent tool for reaching illiterate audiences.</p><p>Video is highly versatile, and can go beyond entertainment to achieve development goals with particular audiences and objectives in mind. It can be shown in a variety of ways (e.g. at public gatherings, on television, on a mobile phone, and from the internet) with the potential to reach many people. Video can also be used to stimulate debates and discussions, and to help resolve conflicts. It can convey opinions and messages from one context or reality to another, in a way that makes unfamiliar issues more accessible to people for example bringing farmer concerns to the attention of policy-makers. Video can offer an effective way of &ldquo;documenting a process and compressing what could be a long story into a short film.&rdquo; It can translate &ldquo;complex problems and processes into easily digestible pieces&rdquo; (Lie and Mandler, 2009). Furthermore, video is useful as part of a process, for example, to help collect data and to monitor changes over time.</p><p>---   <a href=\"https://www.echocommunity.org/resources/ecc0a074-0685-48dd-b690-3ef745bc8a1a\">CTA/Access Agriculture Learning Through the Eyes of Others</a></p>"
